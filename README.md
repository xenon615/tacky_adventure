# Tacky Adventure
Why adventure? Probably because it's a continuation of my own adventure in the world of Rust and Bevy.  
Why tacky? I think you can guess for yourself.

This isn't a game, or even a game sketch.
I just wanted to try out different things I could do with Bevy.

I wholeheartedly bless anyone who finds something interesting in my code to use it for personal purposes.
